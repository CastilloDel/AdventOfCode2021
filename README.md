## Solutions to Advent Of Code 2021
### Daniel del Castillo de la Rosa

This year I decided to participate in the Advent Of Code while learning Haskell.
All the solutions can be found in their respective directory and in one file. Solutions assume knowledge about the problem itself, you can check the problems in the [Advent Of Code page](https://adventofcode.com). Remember this repository is for the 2021 edition!
